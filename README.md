# Solar Flare Dashboard

**Solar Flare Dashboard** is a modern, interactive web application that visualizes NASA solar flare data on a world map. Users can explore solar flare events by date, class (C/M/X), region, and more, with a beautiful, responsive UI and rich tooltips for scientific exploration and educational purposes.

## Features

- üåç **World Map Visualization:** Solar flare events are plotted as colored circles on an interactive world map using D3.js and TopoJSON.
- üîé **Date Range & Class Filtering:** Filter flares by date and by X-ray class (C, M, X) using intuitive controls.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Region Search:** Instantly search for flares by heliographic region or active region number.
- üñ±Ô∏è **Hover Tooltips:** Hover over any flare to see its name or event ID in a floating tooltip.
- üìä **Summary Cards:** See total and per-class flare counts for the selected range.
- üß≠ **Legend & Glossary:** Built-in legend and glossary for quick reference of terms and color codes.
- üìö **About Page:** Learn about solar flares, data sources, and how to read the dashboard.
- üí° **Fully Responsive:** Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices.
- üöÄ **Powered by NASA DONKI API:** Live solar flare data from NASA's official DONKI service.

## V2 Highlights

- **World Map Upgrade:** Replaced the old solar disk with a full equirectangular world map, using D3's geoNaturalEarth1 projection for a more global perspective.
- **Flare Overlay:** Solar flare circles are now accurately projected and overlaid on the world map.
- **Top Navigation Layout:** Moved all navigation, search, and class selectors to a vertical top bar for improved usability and modern dashboard aesthetics.
- **Enhanced Search:** Added a search box to filter flares by region impact or active region number.
- **Scrollable Main Content:** The main dashboard area now supports smooth vertical scrolling for large datasets.
- **Responsive Design:** Improved layout and scaling for all devices and screen sizes.
